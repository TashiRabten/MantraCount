# MantraCount

This project is designed to count instances of mantra submissions through WhatsApp for the Associação Buddha-Dharma associates in Brazil. The application processes export text files from WhatsApp line by line and looks for strings formatted as: "Fiz # mantras de 'mantra name'", which translates to "I did # mantras of 'mantra name'".


## Features

- Reads WhatsApp export text and counts:
  - Total number of mantras submitted.
  - Instances of the word "Fiz".
  - Instances of the word "mantras".
  - Specific mantra names.
- Displays discrepancies with counts, allowing users to correct any errors in the original text and run the program again for an accurate count.

## Requirements

- Java (version X or higher)
- Any standard text editor or IDE for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TashiRabten/MantraCount.git

=======
## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
